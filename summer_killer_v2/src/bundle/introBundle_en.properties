In the early 1960s, Lotte Food introduced the first hygienic facility system in Korea, and began mass-producing high-quality ice cream that can be trusted and eaten. Led by Samgang Hard, the first mass-produced ice cream, Lotte Food is leading the domestic ice cream market by creating numerous hit products such as Tsuba, Amatna, Pig Bar, Gugu, Hazelot Cafe, Turtle Egg, Chrysanthemum Bread, and Ice Cream.

intro_article-desc-2 = Papico, which was first released in 1981, brought a high-end wind of 100 won to the Chubbaryu ice cream, which had a strong image of being cheap for 50 won. Papico has succeeded in capturing the children's tastes by boldly abandoning the fruit taste that Tsuba had adopted and choosing a strong chocolate taste. People's love for Papico is great, and it has risen to the ranks of popular products with annual sales exceeding 20 billion won. In the Korean ice cream industry, ice cream, which overcame the challenges of time as strong as Papico, was so popular that it was hard to pick just five, including Burabocon (1970), Bibibig (1975), and Together (1974).
